# Catpad history
## Overview
Common trackpads in the market are not as good as Apple's ones, in order to get a Magic Trackpad 2 you have to waste around 150 dollars, and it will not work in your computer if you don't own a Mac. The main objective behind Catpad's development is to create a trackpad that works equally or better that Magic Trackpad's Apple pad that costs nothing to you, and of course Open Source.
